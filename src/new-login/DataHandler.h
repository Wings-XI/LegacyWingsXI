/**
 *  Data handler class, create an object for each connecting client.
 *  The data protocol is between the server and the bootloader, designed
 *  to emulate certain traffic that on retail is apparently done by
 *  POL. On retail POL seems to request the server to send certain packets
 *  on the view port to the client (as well as the other way). Since we
 *  don't use POL, the data port is used to negotiate when these packets
 *  are sent.
