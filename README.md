### Bug Reports and Unimplemented Features
Bugs and issues pertaining to this code base should go to this project's bug tracker, which you can find here: https://gitlab.com/ffxiwings/wings/-/issues

Bugs pertaining to the current Wings server (until it gets migrated to this code base) should go here: https://gitlab.com/Gweivyth/wingsxi-bugs/-/issues

Before reporting issues please make sure that:
1. Your local tree is fully updated and that all server processes have been rebuilt form the latest code.
2. The database is in full sync with the latest source tree.
3. You are using the latest Wings installer, available on our Discord.

Bug reports should include steps to reproduce the bug.

We do take issues detailing unimplemented features _if_ the feature is _retail behavior, era accurate_, and the issue report adequetly covers everything about that feature which is missing.
